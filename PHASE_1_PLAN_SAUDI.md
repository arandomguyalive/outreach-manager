# TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: PHASE I - SOVEREIGN NODE INFRASTRUCTURE (NEOM)
**Project:** ABHED Sovereign Infrastructure
**Architects:** Kinjal Mishra & Roy (Unified Core)
**Prepared for:** The Private Office of HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Classification:** SOVEREIGN TOP SECRET // EYES ONLY

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This proposal defines the Phase I implementation of the ABHED protocol as the cognitive foundation for **NEOM** and **The Line**. Structured according to the initial tranches authorized by **HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman**, Phase I focuses on establishing the Sovereign Node infrastructure and the first pilot zone deployment.

## 2. Infrastructure Phasing (Tranche-Based)

### Tranche 1: Sovereign Node Foundation ($400M)
*   **Infrastructure:** Deployment of the liquid-cooled, air-gapped **Sovereign Node** backbone at Sindalah Island.
*   **Core Logic:** Implementation of the server-zero peer-to-peer discovery layer for the Kingdom's independent zones.
*   **Hardware:** Issuance of the first batch of hardware-hardened devices with **TEE-level** encryption gating.

### Tranche 2: The Line Pilot Zone ($400M)
*   **Location:** Integration of ABHED **Edge Compute Nodes (ECNs)** into the first 500-meter structural module of The Line.
*   **Linear Topology:** Optimization of the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for the unique 170km geometry of the city.
*   **Local Inference:** Deployment of localized AI inference containers that operate within the device's "Digital Bunker," ensuring zero data leakage.

## 3. The "Cognitive City" Layer
Phase I establishes NEOM as a "Post-Cloud" environment:
*   **Data Sovereignty:** All citizen data is physically bound to the device; the city "thinks" locally without a central brain.
*   **Proof of Humanity:** Integration of hardware-biometric handshakes as the primary authentication protocol for the independent zone.
*   **The Sanctuary Protocol:** Protocol-level "Quiet Zones" designed to protect the user's cognitive bandwidth from algorithmic noise.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap (12 Weeks)

### Block 1: Sindalah Setup & RF Mapping (Weeks 1-4)
*   **Action:** Deployment of the Tranche 1 Command Cluster. Detailed RF mapping of the initial Line module to ensure sub-100ms handshake latency.

### Block 2: TEE Kernel Integration (Weeks 5-8)
*   **Action:** Finalizing OS-level hooks for the NEOM-wide sovereign OS. Establishing the "Secure Boot" chain for all city-linked devices.

### Block 3: Pilot Onboarding & Launch (Weeks 9-12)
*   **Action:** Onboarding the first 1,000 "Citizen Pioneers" and the administrative core. 
*   **Status:** **NEOM COGNITIVE BACKBONE ACTIVE.**

## 5. Operational Mandate
The Duo (Kinjal & Roy) operates as the primary architects of the Keystone. Saudi technical teams (G42/Oxagon) will manage the Layer 1 physical integration and solar-kinetic power harvesting for the ECN clusters.

---

## 6. Closing Protocol
With the activation of Phase I, NEOM ceases to be a smart city and becomes a **Sovereign Intelligence**.

**"We do not build for the present. We architect the inevitable."**
