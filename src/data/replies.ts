      body: `Hi Kinjal & Team,

We hope this email finds you well. Naman (MortaL) forwarded your YouTube teaser video to our internal management group after it appeared in his recommendations last night. He was struck by the visual fidelity of the 'Vortex' interface—it aligns perfectly with the high-tech, cyberpunk aesthetic that the gaming community resonates with.

From a security standpoint, our primary concern at 8Bit is the integrity of private team comms. We have faced issues with leaks on Discord and WhatsApp in the past. Your mention of 'Forensic Protection' and 'Hold-to-View' mechanics caught our attention immediately. Naman specifically asked if this prevents screen recording on iOS devices as well?

We are ready to proceed with the Blacklist enrollment for Naman and potentially 2 other key members of S8UL. Please share the invoice and a technical whitepaper if available so our tech lead can verify the encryption claims.

Best regards,
Animesh Agarwal

Thank you for the detailed outreach. Sharan came across your Instagram handle (@iamkm18) via a suggested post and spent some time analyzing the 'Sovereign' value proposition. In the finance content space, having a secure, noise-free channel for high-net-worth discussions is a massive unmet need.

We are particularly interested in the 'Vault' feature you alluded to. Does this allow for compartmentalized discussions that are invisible to the wider network? That would be a deal-breaker (in a good way) for the kind of exclusive community Sharan is building.

We appreciate the vision of a homegrown Indian platform taking on global privacy giants. We are ready to enroll in the Blacklist tier immediately. Please send the payment link and let us know if there is an onboarding call included.

Regards,
Team Sharan`,

I must say, the YouTube algorithm knows me well. Your 'State of the Art' teaser popped up on my feed, and I actually sat through the whole thing. The UI fluidity is something I usually only see in Silicon Valley consumer social apps, not early-stage Indian startups.

I'm very intrigued by the 'Digital Sovereignty' angle. With the way platforms are clamping down on reach and data ownership, a decentralized-feeling, privacy-first network is exactly where the puck is moving. I want to secure my spot on the Blacklist not just as a user, but because I want to support this kind of ambitious engineering from India.

Please send me the lifetime enrollment link. Also, curious—are you planning to open this up to a wider beta later, or will it remain strictly gated? Let's chat.

Cheers,

I saw the 'Inner Billionaire' clip on Instagram Explore. First off, huge respect for building a custom design system instead of slapping together Tailwind components. It shows you care about the craft.

I've been preaching about 'owning your audience' to my students for years. If ABHED truly offers a sovereign layer where the algorithm doesn't dictate visibility, I'm all in. I'm ready to enroll in the Blacklist right now.

Quick question: Does the 'Infinity Key' include API access down the line? I'd love to build some custom integrations for my community if that's on the roadmap.

Send the payment details.

Your video on YouTube regarding 'Forensic Protection' was very timely. I was just discussing with my legal team about the risks of screenshot leaks in my premium consultation groups. The current platforms are just too porous.

I'm very interested in enrolling in the Blacklist, specifically to test if this can be the primary hub for my 'Inner Circle' members. The fact that it's an Indian product compliant with the new DPDP norms makes it much easier for me to recommend it to my clients.

Please share the enrollment invoice. Also, do you offer any bulk access packages if I want to bring my top 10 clients onboard later?

Tanmay sent us a link to your Instagram reel that showed up on his feed. He's obsessed with the 'Dystopian/Cyberpunk' art direction—he said it looks like 'Blade Runner met Telegram'. It's a breath of fresh air compared to the boring corporate blues of Twitter and LinkedIn.

We are definitely interested in securing a Blacklist spot for him. He wants to know if the 'Vortex' feed supports high-bitrate video uploads? He's looking for a place to drop raw, uncompressed thoughts without the YouTube compression killing the vibe.

We are ready to enroll. Please send the payment link and let us know the file size limits.

I'm currently traveling in Europe, but I saw your ad on Instagram and had to stop scrolling. The branding is top-tier. You rarely see Indian founders nailing the 'premium' aesthetic this hard before launch.

The privacy narrative is going to be the biggest theme of 2026. Everyone is tired of being tracked. If you can deliver on the 'Zero-Knowledge' promise, this is a unicorn in the making.

I want in. My team is ready to process the Blacklist enrollment fee today. Send the details. Also, are you raising? I might be interested in more than just a membership.

Keep crushing it.

Gaurav sir watched the technical breakdown video on your YouTube channel. He was quite impressed by the mention of 'Local Key Generation' on the device itself. That is a very high standard of security, usually only found in hardware wallets.

He is interested in enrolling in the Blacklist tier to personally test the encryption speed and the app's battery optimization on flagship devices. It is a proud moment to see such advanced cryptography being implemented by an Indian team.

Please share the invoice for enrollment. We would like to get access as soon as the beta build is live.

I came across the Instagram reel as a suggestion. This is bold. I like bold. The market is crowded, but a privacy-first, design-led social tool from India is a huge gap.

I often talk about 'Signal vs. Noise'. It seems ABHED is built entirely for Signal. I'd be happy to enroll as an early adopter and move some of my more private conversations there.

Please sign me up for the Blacklist tier and send the invoice. Is there a cap on the number of members in the initial cohort?

I reviewed the links you sent. As someone who tracks the fintech regulatory space, the data sovereignty aspect is compliant with the new Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is a huge plus. Most foreign apps are going to struggle with this.

Glad to see an Indian firm taking compliance seriously from Day 1. I'm interested in the Blacklist enrollment and would like to proceed with the next steps. Do you have a privacy policy draft I can look at?
