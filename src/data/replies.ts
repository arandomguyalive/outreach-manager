We hope this email finds you well. Naman (MortaL) forwarded your initial pitch to us. He first saw the values of ABHED in your YouTube teaser, but he just finished watching the private App Tour video you linked in the email. He was struck by the visual fidelity of the 'Vortex' interface—it aligns perfectly with the high-tech aesthetic gamers love.

From a security standpoint, our primary concern is the integrity of private team comms. We have faced issues with leaks on Discord and WhatsApp in the past. Your mention of 'Forensic Protection' caught our attention. Naman specifically asked: does this feature actively block screen recording on iOS, or is it just a deterrent?

We are ready to proceed with the Blacklist enrollment. Please share the invoice and any technical documentation regarding the anti-leak measures.

Thank you for the detailed outreach. Sharan came across your Instagram handle (@iamkm18) via a suggested post, and the privacy values you spoke about really resonated. He just watched the Drive App Tour video to get a better look at the UI.

One specific question came up during our review: Does the app have a 'Vault' or 'Hidden Folder' feature? We saw the encryption protocols in the video, but for high-net-worth discussions, we often need a space that is completely invisible from the main chat list. If this exists, it's a huge selling point for us.

We appreciate the vision of a homegrown Indian platform taking on global privacy giants. We are ready to enroll in the Blacklist tier immediately. Please send the payment link.

Siddhartha asked me to reach out after he saw your 'Values of ABHED' video on his feed. He has also reviewed the App Tour on Drive. He was quite impressed by the UI fluidity, noting it rivals Silicon Valley standards.

He is intrigued by the 'Digital Sovereignty' angle and wants to support this kind of ambitious engineering from India. He specifically asked if the 'Blacklist' tier comes with advanced community moderation tools for his exclusive founder's circle?

We would like to secure a spot for him on the Blacklist. Please share the lifetime enrollment link.

I saw the 'Inner Billionaire' clip on Instagram Explore, but thanks for sending the deep-dive Drive link. First off, huge respect for building a custom design system. It's incredibly inspiring to see a female founder from our ecosystem focusing on deep tech.

The feature that really blew my mind in the tour was the 'Geo-Fenced Encryption'. The idea that messages and posts can be physically locked to a coordinate is a revolution. I haven't seen this implemented in any mainstream social app before. It totally changes how we can build IRL communities.

Quick question: Does the 'Infinity Key' include API access? I'd love to experiment with these location triggers.

Akshat reviewed your YouTube video and the App Tour you linked. The section regarding 'Forensic Protection' was very timely, as we were just discussing the risks of screenshot leaks in our premium consultation groups.

We are interested in enrolling Akshat in the Blacklist to test if this can be the primary hub for his 'Inner Circle' members. One query from our side: Does the app support auto-deletion timers for messages and files?

The fact that it's an Indian product compliant with the new DPDP norms is a major plus. Please share the enrollment invoice.

We are definitely interested in securing a Blacklist spot for him. He wants to know about the media capabilities—does the 'Vortex' feed support 4K uploads without aggressive compression? He wants a place to drop high-fidelity raw footage for his core fans.

Raj is currently traveling in Europe, but he forwarded your email after seeing your ad on Instagram. He was very impressed by the branding and the 'premium' aesthetic shown in the Drive video.

What really caught his attention was the 'Geo-Fencing' capability. He mentioned that being able to drop exclusive content locked to a specific city (like London or Dubai) for his audience to 'unlock' is a revolution for creators on tour. He's never seen a feature like this executed so cleanly.

We would like to process the Blacklist enrollment fee today on his behalf. Please send the details.

He is interested in enrolling in the Blacklist tier to personally test the app. Specifically, he wants to check the battery optimization impact of the local encryption engine on flagship devices. Did you optimize for NPU usage?

Shlok (Tech Burner) saw the reel you posted about the "Vortex" UI. He usually skips these, but the visual style caught his eye—he said it looks like "Iron Man's JARVIS met UPI".

We checked the Drive video. The animation smoothness is crazy. Is this running on a custom engine or standard Android views? Shlok wants to try it out on the new foldables to see if the UI breaks or adapts.

If the "Geo-Fencing" works as advertised, that's valid content material. We are down for the Blacklist access.
