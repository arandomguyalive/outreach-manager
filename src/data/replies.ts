Def want to see how you handled the React state management for the encryption without blocking the main thread. I'm interested in enrolling for the early access just to check out the engineering.

I saw the 'Inner Billionaire' clip on Instagram Explore, but thanks for sending the deep-dive Drive link. First off, huge respect for building a custom design system. It's incredibly inspiring to see a female founder from our ecosystem focusing on deep tech.

The feature that really blew my mind in the tour was the 'Geo-Fenced Encryption'. The idea that messages and posts can be physically locked to a coordinate is a revolution. I haven't seen this implemented in any mainstream social app before. It totally changes how we can build IRL communities.

Quick question: Does the 'Infinity Key' include API access? I'd love to experiment with these location triggers.

Komal absolutely loved the visual direction of the app in the video you sent. She said the 'Vortex' interface is the first time a tech product has looked "fashion-editorial" ready.

We have a specific use case: Unreleased shoot previews. We often share mood boards and raw edits with stylists, and we've had issues with screenshots leaking before the official drop. Does the 'Vault' feature prevent screen recording on iPhones specifically?

If yes, we need this immediately for her production workflow.

Please share the payment link.

I saw the 'App Tour' video. I usually don't reply to cold mails, but the attention to detail in your UI is rare. The haptic feedback logic you described for the 'Vortex' unlock... that's the kind of obsession we look for.

It is genuinely refreshing to see a female founder leading such a hardcore engineering project. We need more innovators like you who aren't afraid to build deep tech from India.

I want to test the latency myself. If this is truly peer-to-peer with no server relay, it solves a logistics communication problem for me.

Lewis watched the demo. He is always looking for technology that aligns with his values of purpose and efficiency.

He loved the "Sustainability" angle Greta mentioned—tech that doesn't "boil the ocean." But from a driver's perspective, he's obsessed with the zero-latency p2p handshake. In F1, milliseconds are everything. Seeing that same level of engineering applied to human rights and privacy is powerful.

He wants to support this. Please send the details for the Blacklist enrollment.

Ms. Rowling has reviewed your proposal.

She has spent decades protecting the "Secrets" of her worlds from premature leaks.

I read your note. This is "Day 1" thinking.

Most companies treat customer data as *their* asset. You are treating it as the *customer's* asset. That is the ultimate form of customer obsession. By removing the server, you have removed the conflict of interest that plagues the entire social media industry.

It is a hard engineering problem, but the best way to predict the future is to invent it. You are inventing a future where privacy is the default setting.

I checked the p2p logic.

As AI generates infinite noise, verified human connection will become the scarcest resource on the planet. We are entering an era where we need "Digital Clean Rooms" to know we are speaking to a human, not a model.

Abhed is effectively a Turing Test for intimacy. If the encryption keys are physically bound to the device and the biometric signature, it creates a "Proof of Humanity" layer that is very valuable.
