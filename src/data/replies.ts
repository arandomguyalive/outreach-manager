I saw the 'Inner Billionaire' clip on Instagram Explore, but thanks for sending the deep-dive Drive link. First off, huge respect for building a custom design system. It's incredibly inspiring to see a female founder from our ecosystem focusing on deep tech.

The feature that really blew my mind in the tour was the 'Geo-Fenced Encryption'. The idea that messages and posts can be physically locked to a coordinate is a revolution. I haven't seen this implemented in any mainstream social app before. It totally changes how we can build IRL communities.

Quick question: Does the 'Infinity Key' include API access? I'd love to experiment with these location triggers.

My team forwarded your email. I watched the 'Digital Sovereignty' video. You are speaking my language. We need to break the shackles of Western big tech.

Your 'Local Key' approach is exactly how we should be building for India. No data leaving the device = true independence.

I'm interested in how this integrates with local map data. Are you using Google Maps or an open alternative? I might have something for you there.

I'm in for the Blacklist. Let's build for Bharat.

Sandeep Sir watched your video personally. He was moved by your statement: "Privacy is not a luxury, it's a right."

He receives thousands of partnership offers, but he rejects them all because they are usually about extracting data or money from students. Your platform seems different. It seems to be about *protecting* them.

He wants to use this to create a "Safe Circle" for students dealing with depression, where they can speak without fear of their chats being leaked or tracked.

If your purpose is true, he will support this. No charge.

I have seen your 'App Tour'.

When I built Telegram, the goal was to give people back their freedom. But you have taken it a step further with the 'Local Key' architecture. Eliminating the server relay entirely for the handshake is bold.

I like the 'Vortex' UI. It feels fluid, like liquid. 

I am interested in more than just the Blacklist. We should discuss whether Abhed should remain independent or if we should be working together as one team. A technology this sovereign deserves a global stage. Let's talk about the future—and perhaps an acquisition.

I normally don't respond to external inquiries, but your 'App Tour' circulated among a few of us here in Cupertino.

The way you are leveraging the Neural Engine (NPU) for real-time decryption without impacting the UI frame rate is impressive work. We constantly talk about "Privacy is a fundamental human right," and seeing a sovereign implementation like this is validating.

I'd be interested to know if you are using Metal for the 'Vortex' rendering layer. The uncompromising focus on both the 'how' (engineering) and the 'why' (design/privacy) reminds me of the early days here with Steve.
