We hope this email finds you well. Naman (MortaL) forwarded your initial pitch to us. He first saw the values of ABHED in your YouTube teaser, but he just finished watching the private App Tour video you linked in the email. He was struck by the visual fidelity of the 'Vortex' interface—it aligns perfectly with the high-tech aesthetic gamers love.

From a security standpoint, our primary concern is the integrity of private team comms. We have faced issues with leaks on Discord and WhatsApp in the past. Your mention of 'Forensic Protection' caught our attention. Naman specifically asked: does this feature actively block screen recording on iOS, or is it just a deterrent?

We are ready to proceed with the Blacklist enrollment. Please share the invoice and any technical documentation regarding the anti-leak measures.

Best regards,

Thank you for the detailed outreach. Sharan came across your Instagram handle (@iamkm18) via a suggested post, and the privacy values you spoke about really resonated. He just watched the Drive App Tour video to get a better look at the UI.

One specific question came up during our review: Does the app have a 'Vault' or 'Hidden Folder' feature? We saw the encryption protocols in the video, but for high-net-worth discussions, we often need a space that is completely invisible from the main chat list. If this exists, it's a huge selling point for us.

We appreciate the vision of a homegrown Indian platform taking on global privacy giants. We are ready to enroll in the Blacklist tier immediately. Please send the payment link.

I must say, the YouTube algorithm knows me well—your 'Values of ABHED' video popped up on my feed first. I just watched the full App Tour on Drive that you sent over. The UI fluidity shown in that demo is something I usually only see in Silicon Valley consumer social apps.

I'm very intrigued by the 'Digital Sovereignty' angle. I noticed the community features in the video—does the 'Blacklist' tier come with advanced moderation tools? I'm thinking of using this for a very exclusive founder's circle, and I need to know if I can delegate admin rights securely.

I want to secure my spot on the Blacklist not just as a user, but because I want to support this kind of ambitious engineering from India. Please send me the lifetime enrollment link.

I saw the 'Inner Billionaire' clip on Instagram Explore, but thanks for sending the deep-dive Drive link. First off, huge respect for building a custom design system. The way the 'Vortex' feed renders in the video shows you care about the craft.

I've been preaching about 'owning your audience' to my students for years. If ABHED truly offers a sovereign layer where the algorithm doesn't dictate visibility—as you claimed in the walkthrough—I'm all in.

Quick question: Does the 'Infinity Key' include API access down the line? I'd love to build some custom bots or integrations for my community if that's on the roadmap.

Send the payment details. I'm ready to enroll.

Your video on YouTube was great for understanding the philosophy, but the App Tour you linked provided the context I needed on the UX.

I'm very interested in enrolling in the Blacklist. However, for my 'Inner Circle' members, data retention is a concern. Does the app support auto-deletion timers for messages and files? Like a 'burn after reading' setting? That wasn't explicitly clear in the demo.

The fact that it's an Indian product compliant with the new DPDP norms makes it much easier for me to recommend it. Please share the enrollment invoice.

Tanmay sent us a link to your Instagram reel initially. We just reviewed the Drive video together. He's obsessed with the 'Dystopian/Cyberpunk' art direction shown in the UI tour—he said it looks like 'Blade Runner met Telegram'.

We are definitely interested in securing a Blacklist spot for him. He wants to know about the media capabilities—does the 'Vortex' feed support 4K uploads without aggressive compression? He wants a place to drop high-fidelity raw footage for his core fans.

We are ready to enroll. Please send the payment link and let us know the file size limits.

I'm currently traveling in Europe, but I watched the Drive video you attached. The branding is top-tier. You rarely see Indian founders nailing the 'premium' aesthetic this hard before launch. The transition animations you showed were buttery smooth.

The privacy narrative is going to be the biggest theme of 2026. If you can deliver on the 'Zero-Knowledge' promise explained in the video, this is a unicorn in the making.

I want in. My team is ready to process the Blacklist enrollment fee today. Send the details. Also, totally separate topic—are you opening an angel round? I might be interested in more than just a membership.

Keep crushing it.

Gaurav sir watched the technical breakdown in the Google Drive video you shared. He was quite impressed by the demonstration of 'Local Key Generation' on the device itself. That is a very high standard of security.

He is interested in enrolling in the Blacklist tier to personally test the app. Specifically, he wants to check the battery optimization impact of the local encryption engine on flagship devices. Did you optimize for NPU usage?

It is a proud moment to see such advanced cryptography being implemented by an Indian team. Please share the invoice for enrollment.

I came across the Instagram reel as a suggestion, and the App Tour video in your email confirmed my interest. This is bold. I like bold. The market is crowded, but a privacy-first, design-led social tool from India is a huge gap.

I'd be happy to enroll as an early adopter. Quick question: Is there a cap on the number of members in the initial cohort? I want to make sure I can bring in my co-founders later.

I reviewed the links you sent, including the App Tour. As someone who tracks the fintech regulatory space, the data sovereignty aspect mentioned in the video is compliant with the new Digital Personal Data Protection Act.

One compliance question: Are the encryption keys generated and stored strictly on the Indian user's device? That's a crucial detail for my audit.

I'm interested in the Blacklist enrollment and would like to proceed with the next steps.
