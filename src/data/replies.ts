We hope this email finds you well. Naman (MortaL) forwarded your initial pitch to us. He first saw the values of ABHED in your YouTube teaser, but he just finished watching the private App Tour video you linked in the email. He was struck by the visual fidelity of the 'Vortex' interface—it aligns perfectly with the high-tech aesthetic gamers love.

From a security standpoint, our primary concern is the integrity of private team comms. We have faced issues with leaks on Discord and WhatsApp in the past. Your mention of 'Forensic Protection' caught our attention. Naman specifically asked: does this feature actively block screen recording on iOS, or is it just a deterrent?

We are ready to proceed with the Blacklist enrollment. Please share the invoice and any technical documentation regarding the anti-leak measures.

Thank you for the detailed outreach. Sharan came across your Instagram handle (@iamkm18) via a suggested post, and the privacy values you spoke about really resonated. He just watched the Drive App Tour video to get a better look at the UI.

One specific question came up during our review: Does the app have a 'Vault' or 'Hidden Folder' feature? We saw the encryption protocols in the video, but for high-net-worth discussions, we often need a space that is completely invisible from the main chat list. If this exists, it's a huge selling point for us.

We appreciate the vision of a homegrown Indian platform taking on global privacy giants. We are ready to enroll in the Blacklist tier immediately. Please send the payment link.

The feature that really blew my mind in the tour was the 'Geo-Fenced Encryption'. The idea that messages and posts can be physically locked to a coordinate is a revolution. I haven't seen this implemented in any mainstream social app before. It totally changes how we can build IRL communities.

      body: `Hi Kinjal,

My team forwarded your email. I watched the 'Digital Sovereignty' video. You are speaking my language. We need to break the shackles of Western big tech.

Your 'Local Key' approach is exactly how we should be building for India. No data leaving the device = true independence.

I'm interested in how this integrates with local map data. Are you using Google Maps or an open alternative? I might have something for you there.

I'm in for the Blacklist. Let's build for Bharat.

Sandeep Sir watched your video personally. He was moved by your statement: "Privacy is not a luxury, it's a right."

He receives thousands of partnership offers, but he rejects them all because they are usually about extracting data or money from students. Your platform seems different. It seems to be about *protecting* them.

He wants to use this to create a "Safe Circle" for students dealing with depression, where they can speak without fear of their chats being leaked or tracked.

If your purpose is true, he will support this. No charge.

Please let us know the next steps.

Regards,

I have seen your 'App Tour'.

When I built Telegram, the goal was to give people back their freedom. But you have taken it a step further with the 'Local Key' architecture. Eliminating the server relay entirely for the handshake is bold.

I like the 'Vortex' UI. It feels fluid, like liquid. 

I am interested in more than just the Blacklist. We should discuss whether Abhed should remain independent or if we should be working together as one team. A technology this sovereign deserves a global stage. Let's talk about the future—and perhaps an acquisition.

My team showed me the 'Inner Billionaire' reel. The branding is sick. Honestly, most tech products from India look boring, but this has that premium "Apple meets Cyberpunk" vibe.

I love the 'haptic' detail you mentioned in the tour video. We obsess over that stuff at boAt.

I'm interested in the Blacklist. Also, purely hypothetical—could we bundle a 'Vortex' access key with our limited edition premium audio gear? Think about it.

Send the invoice. I'm in.

I normally don't respond to external inquiries, but your 'App Tour' circulated among a few of us here in Cupertino.

The way you are leveraging the Neural Engine (NPU) for real-time decryption without impacting the UI frame rate is impressive work. We constantly talk about "Privacy is a fundamental human right," and seeing a sovereign implementation like this is validating.

I'd be interested to know if you are using Metal for the 'Vortex' rendering layer. The uncompromising focus on both the 'how' (engineering) and the 'why' (design/privacy) reminds me of the early days here with Steve. Your vision for Abhed carries that same Jobsian spirit—building something so right that it feels inevitable.

I'd like to personally test the build. Please enroll me in the early access.

I saw the clips. Honestly, most "privacy" apps look like they were designed in 2005, but this UI is something else. The "Vortex" animation is incredibly clean—is that a custom rendering engine?

I watched the App Tour video. The matte-black aesthetic and the haptic feedback logic you're talking about really resonate with our "Quality First" philosophy. One question for the review: How are you handling the latency for the Peer-to-Peer handshake on cellular data? If it's as fast as the video shows, that’s a breakthrough.

I'm down to enroll in the Blacklist. Send the link.

Arun here. I watched the 'App Tour' video you sent. It is genuinely one of the most visually stunning pieces of software I’ve seen in a long time. The way you've integrated the NPU for on-device encryption is exactly the kind of "Future Tech" we love to cover.

I'm particularly interested in the 'Forensic Protection' feature. If this can actually stop metadata leaks at the hardware level, it's a game changer for high-profile users. 

I'd like to join the Blacklist. Please send the enrollment details.

I watched the Drive link. I don't care about the encryption math, but I care about the "Geo-Fencing" feature. 

The idea that I can leave a digital vlog at the top of a building in NYC that only people physically there can see? That’s not a social app, that’s an adventure. It adds a layer of reality to the internet that's been missing.

I'm in. Let's do this.

I saw your 'Inner Billionaire' clip and then sat through the whole App Tour video. First off—the UI is insane. It looks like it belongs in the year 2050.

I'm all about scale. If this thing can actually handle millions of people using 'Geo-Fenced' drops without the servers melting (or well, since you have no servers, without the mesh breaking), then this is the biggest thing in tech. I want to test it. Can we do a 'Blacklist' drop where only people at a specific coordinate can unlock a prize?

I'm ready to enroll. Let's see if this can handle the Beast audience.

I watched the 'Digital Sovereignty' video you sent. It’s wild. We’re living in a time where every word we say is being tracked and sold. Seeing an Indian team build a "Digital Bunker" with no central point of failure is exactly what the world needs right now.

I love the 'Vortex' aesthetic, but I’m here for the encryption. If I can host a long-form encrypted audio session that can’t be intercepted or de-platformed, you’ve won.

I’m in for the Blacklist. Send the details. We need more of this.

Your "App Tour" was brought to my attention by our engineering team. We've been tracking the "Digital Sovereignty" movement, but your implementation of a server-less handshake is uniquely efficient.

While we focus on global connectivity, the "Abhed" model of isolated, geo-fenced nodes presents an interesting alternative for high-privacy segments. I'd like to enroll in the early access to understand the user retention logic of such a decentralized system.

We are watching your progress closely.

I watched the tour. You've built from First Principles. 

Peer-to-peer is the only way to achieve true sovereignty. Most "privacy" apps are just centralized honey pots. Abhed seems to understand that the user *is* the infrastructure.

The 'Infinity Key' concept is elegant. I'm interested in the Blacklist access. I don't care about the UI—I care about the math. And the math looks right.

Stay sovereign.
