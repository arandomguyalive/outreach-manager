      body: "Hi Kinjal & Team,\n\nWe hope you're having a productive week.\n\nNaman (MortaL) came across one of your teaser videos on his feed yesterday. He was genuinely impressed by the visual direction—the 'Cyberpunk' aesthetic is unlike anything we've seen from an Indian app developer. It feels very premium and aligned with the gaming culture.\n\nHe is definitely interested in the enrollment for the Blacklist tier. We are particularly interested in the 'Forensic Protection' feature mentioned in your pitch, as leaking is a huge issue for us. Could you share more details on how the onboarding works for the initial cohort?\n\nPlease let us know the next steps. We are ready to move forward with the lifetime enrollment once we have the final details.\n\nBest regards,\nAnimesh Agarwal\nManager, 8Bit Creatives",

The emphasis on data privacy is exactly what his high-net-worth audience asks for.\n\nIt's refreshing to see a homegrown Indian product that doesn't compromise on design or security. We are definitely interested in the Blacklist enrollment. Before we proceed with the formal process, Sharan wanted to know if the 'Infinity Key' grants access to the beta build showcased in your video? We'd love to test it out.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nRegards,\nTeam Sharan",

The way you've visualized the 'Vortex' feed is something I haven't seen since the early days of Clubhouse, but with way better tech.\n\nBig kudos for building this out of India. I'm definitely interested in enrolling for the lifetime tier. It's rare to see this level of polish in the pre-launch phase. Please share the enrollment details and the payment link.\n\nAlso, once you launch, let's connect. This might be a great story for the podcast.\n\nCheers,\nSiddhartha",
