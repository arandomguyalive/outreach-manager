He is genuinely impressed by the privacy-first architecture you've built, especially coming from an Indian dev team. It's rare to see this level of polish in domestic security products.\n\nWe are interested in exploring the 'Sovereign' tier for our internal team communications. Could you please share the payment invoice and onboarding steps at your earliest convenience?\n\nBest regards,\nAnimesh Agarwal\nManager, 8Bit Creatives"

We'd like to move forward with the Blacklist membership immediately. Please forward the payment link and any relevant NDA documents if required for the beta access.\n\nRegards,\nTeam Sharan"

The UI is stellar, and the underlying tech stack (E2EE + Local) is exactly what the ecosystem needs right now.\n\nBig kudos for building this out of India. I want to support this. Please send me the payment link for the lifetime tier. Might even talk about it on the pod if it holds up during testing.\n\nCheers,\nSiddhartha"

I'm definitely in for the Blacklist. Send me the payment details right now, I want to reserve my handle before the public launch.\n\nCheers,\nTanay"
