# PROJECT LOG - ABHED OUTREACH MANAGER

## Executive Summary & Exclusivity Analysis

### **Vision & Narrative**
The Abhed Outreach Manager has evolved from a lead-tracking tool into a high-fidelity **Sovereign Tech Validation Simulator**. It is designed to demonstrate the massive market pull and elite-level interest in ABHED's "Anti-Server" and "Geo-Fenced" architecture. The narrative centers on **Kinjal Mishra**, an independent female founder leading a hardcore engineering project that challenges global data giants.
