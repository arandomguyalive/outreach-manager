- **Context:** The previous update (3.7.2) inadvertently overwrote the specific "154th Floor / Abhed Zone" proposal with a generic "Silence/Luxury" text. This broke the continuity of the subsequent outbound reply (which references the 154th floor).
- **Result:** The conversation thread now flows correctly:
    1. **Alabbar:** Proposes the "Abhed Zone" at the 154th floor.
    2. **Kinjal:** Accepts the challenge ("Vault in the Sky").
    3. **Alabbar:** Escalates to investment ("Foundational Stake").

    - Restored the correct conversation flow:
        1. **Alabbar (Inbound):** Visionary note on "Silence as Luxury."
        2. **Kinjal (Outbound):** The "Vault in the Sky" pitch.
        3. **Alabbar (Inbound):** The final investment invitation.
    - Ensures the narrative matches the specific "154th floor pilot" context.
- **Tech:** Updated `Influencer` type to support `thread[]`, bumped `DATA_VERSION` to `v3.7.1`.

### **Phase 3.7.1 - The Alabbar Escalation (Jan 30, 2026)**

- **Feature: Strict Intercept Logic:**
    - **No Cold Outreach:** Modified `useInfluencers.ts` to strictly remove any "Email Sent" history for "Intercept" designated accounts (CIA, MI6, Unit 8200). These entities now have a clean history starting directly with "⚠ Signal Detected."
    - **Dynamic 'To' Addressing:** Implemented realistic recipient routing. Replies now correctly show addressed to `info@abhed.co` (standard) or `SECURE_NODE_VORTEX_01` (intercepts), replacing the generic logic.
    - **Event Type:** Officially registered `Signal Detected` as a distinct interaction type in the TypeScript definitions.
- **Refinement:**
    - Updated `REPLY_DATA` to include realistic `to` addresses for all 109+ replies, ensuring the entire communication chain looks authentic.

    - Status: Introduced the **Red "⚠ Intercept" Badge** with pulsing visual feedback.
    - Logic: Prevented the system from injecting fake "Initial Sent Emails" for Intercepts; history now starts with **"⚠ Signal Detected."**

    - **Domain vs. App:** Clarified that Red Teams attacked the *domain/infrastructure* (attempting injection), not the app binary, maintaining the "Invite Only" exclusivity.
    - **Specific Threats:** Integrated existential warnings into high-stakes replies (e.g., CIA: "We know where you sleep," Unit 8200: "Do not invite the spear").
- **New Titans:** General Michael Hayden (Ex-CIA/NSA), Sir Richard Moore (MI6), Alex Karp (Palantir), Unit 8200, Vatican Swiss Guard.

- **Realism Injection:** Audited the "Mega" tier Titan replies (CR7, Mbappe, Drake, Shakira, Federer, Dua Lipa) and converted them from "Direct" to "Management/Team" communication.
- **Logic:** High-net-worth individuals do not manage their own cold inboxes. The replies now come from "Team KM", "CR7 Management", "OVO Sound", etc., referring to the talent in the third person while maintaining the specific vision.

### **Phase 3.3.4 - Narrative Consistency Fix (Jan 30, 2026)**
