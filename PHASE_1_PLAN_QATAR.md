# TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: PHASE I - THE DIPLOMATIC FORTRESS (AMIRI DIWAN)
**Project:** ABHED Sovereign Infrastructure
**Architects:** Kinjal Mishra & Roy (Unified Core)
**Prepared for:** The Amiri Diwan of the State of Qatar
**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Classification:** SOVEREIGN TOP SECRET // EYES ONLY

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Following the decree from **His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani**, this proposal outlines the Phase I deployment of the ABHED protocol within the **Amiri Diwan** and designated **Diplomatic Zones**. The primary objective is to establish an air-gapped, server-zero communication layer that secures the State’s strategic information flow against external interception.

## 2. Strategic Foundation: The QAR 2.9B Sovereign Grant
The initial allocation of **QAR 2,915,000,000** will be utilized to anchor the following infrastructure:
*   **Central Command Cluster:** Deployment of a liquid-cooled, hardware-hardened Ghost Node cluster at Raffles Doha.
*   **Diwan Mesh Layer:** Establishing a dedicated Layer 2 backhaul within the Amiri Diwan walls, physically severed from the public internet.
*   **VVIP Sovereign Units:** Hardware-level initialization of the first 100 secure nodes for His Highness and the Senior Cabinet.

---

## 3. Technical Objectives: Forensic Immunity & Geo-Fencing
Phase I focuses on proving the protocol's "Diplomatic Pouch" capability:
*   **RF Signature Binding:** Decryption keys will be cryptographically bound to the unique RF environment of the Diwan, preventing data extraction outside the safe zone.
*   **Metadata Scrubbing:** Implementation of the **Zero-Metadata Wrapper** for all cross-border diplomatic traffic, ensuring origin/destination anonymity.
*   **Local Handshake Verification:** Finalizing the iris-palm biometric handshake logic, executed strictly within the device's **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)**.

---

## 4. Immediate Implementation Roadmap (10 Weeks)

### Block 1: Audit & Calibration (Weeks 1-3)
*   **Action:** Technical walkthrough of the Diwan perimeters with State Security to map signal density and identify potential SIGINT leakage points.
*   **Objective:** Zero-Dead-Zone calibration for the Sovereign Mesh.

### Block 2: Infrastructure Hardening (Weeks 4-7)
*   **Action:** Deployment of the **Keystone** units and integration with private government fiber.
*   **Objective:** Establishing the first air-gapped node network.

### Block 3: Verification & Handover (Weeks 8-10)
*   **Action:** Stress-testing the handshake under simulated state-level jamming. Onboarding of the primary VVIP users.
*   **Status:** **DIPLOMATIC FORTRESS ACTIVE.**

## 5. Personnel & Security Mandate
The ABHED Duo (Kinjal & Roy) maintains exclusive control over the core cryptographic primitives. Physical installation and Layer 1 support will be facilitated by the Amiri Guard’s technical department under direct supervision.

---

## 6. Closing Protocol
Phase I transitions Qatar’s most sensitive communications from a policy-based trust model to a **mathematically-guaranteed** sovereignty model.

**"Silence is the bedrock of sovereignty. ABHED is the shield."**
